# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2024**

## Overview

PageFlow is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.

## The Short Version

**We don't collect any data. Period.**

- No accounts required
- No analytics or tracking
- No data sent to servers
- Your books stay on your device

## Information We Collect

**None.**

PageFlow does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app works entirely offline and all data remains on your device.

## Information Stored on Your Device

PageFlow stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **Books**: EPUB files you import
- **Reading Progress**: Which page/chapter you're on
- **Preferences**: Theme, font size, and other settings

This information:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us
- Is not backed up to any server
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the app

## Third-Party Services

PageFlow does not use any third-party services, including:

- ❌ Analytics (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- ❌ Crash reporting
- ❌ Advertising networks
- ❌ Social media integrations
- ❌ Cloud storage services

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any data.

## Children's Privacy

PageFlow does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.

Since we don't collect any data, changes would only clarify our commitment to privacy, not expand data collection.

## iCloud & Backup

If you have iCloud backup enabled on your device, your PageFlow data (books, progress, settings) may be included in your device backup. This is controlled by Apple and your iCloud settings, not by PageFlow.

## Open Source

PageFlow is open source software. You can review our entire codebase to verify our privacy claims:
